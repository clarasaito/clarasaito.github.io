## yey clara, here ur manual
#### read the fucking manual (rtfm) 
please .. at least the below four tiny chapters, with focus, at first. its very important info for understanding and not to fuck up the site.  
then go to the seperate edit parts to edit what u want.

##### global explanation
your website is editable in the [content](https://github.com/clarasaito/clarasaito.github.io/tree/main/content) folder.  
In there u see three folders and one _index and a privacy file.  
The main folder, content, is the home page. The folders inside are workshops & projects page.  
Inside those two folders there is the different subjects, each there own folders.  
There's also a photo starting with feature. this is the background of the page ánd the thumbnail photo of the page above it.  

##### about the _index files
You can edit text and summary there, and more, i'lll explain later. NOT title!
fyi: the description should be (best) min and max 160 characters. It is not sufficient now. No enters, just txt.  
You will have to decide what u want people to read there.  

##### about the index files
what is in that index files, below the texts {{gallmir}}  
DO NOT TOUCH!! it is the code for the way the galleries are shown.  
u can put some text above or below if u want. Always under the minusses.

##### fucking up
if u fuckup anything and i have an impossibility to do a thing..  
u can go back in commit (saving) history to go back to before what u did:  
this is why it is handy to put a certain personal message in ur commit before saving anything.  
but... avoid it if possible. and make sure i really cannot do anything at all.  
because when i am doing things and u do things at the same time, everything can be even more fucked up :P  
anyway.. in extreme circumstances u can 'quite easily' unfuck the fucks ;) [infos if necessary: revert a commit](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/revert_changes.html#revert-a-commit)  
YAYY (i love this system)

and really .. if u fuckup.. please dont hesistate at all.. call me no worries it happens ;)

## practic manual
#### to change the *texts* in the pages
### _index.md   
No enters. No editting of the folder names or title: cause u messup the frontpage/menu.  

press here for changing text about u: [author](https://github.com/clarasaito/clarasaito.github.io/blob/main/content/authors/admin/_index.md?plain=1)  
this for the text within the projects page: [project](https://github.com/clarasaito/clarasaito.github.io/blob/main/content/project/_index.md?plain=1)  
  - changes are only possible for summary: text:  
this one for the workshop page: [workshop](https://github.com/clarasaito/clarasaito.github.io/blob/main/content/workshops/_index.md?plain=1)  
  - changes are only possible for summary: text:
1. click on the _index file. then,  
2. click the edit button in the right, the pencil icon.  
3. change that text.   
4. save: press commit changes (green button in the right top) u can put a commit message below. it is handy for reference. leave the tick ticked and press the green button, commit changes.

Yay u have edited the page. check the change in ur website! (it *can* take some minutes before the change is visible)

### Index.md
the text below minusses is written in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) language. if u just wanna change a sentence, change it.  
but if u want things in bold, italic, as a heading, etc etc, check the markdown link. it is EASY.  
fyi: two spaces after a line ánd one enter is a new line, two enters a new paragraph.
1. click on the index or _index file. then,  
2. click the edit button in the right, the pencil icon.  
3. change that text.   
4. save: press commit changes (green button in the right top) u can put a commit message below. it is handy for reference but not necessary. leave the tick ticked and press the blue button, commit changes.  

Yay u have then edited the page. check the change in ur website! (it *can* take some minutes before the change is visible)

#### add pics
to add pics, just add them in the images folder which u see in the seperate folders  
best is to have jpg/jpeg for pictures.  
the sequence is numerically then alfabetically  
1. press the plus folder within the video/pictures folder
2. add photo
3. save:  press commit changes (green button in the right top) if u want put a commit message, leave the tick ticked and press the green button, commit changes.

Yayy now u have added a photo/video.. check the change in the website! (it *can* take some minutes before the change is visible)

#### change background in the seperate pages  
if u want a different photo in the background of the page, it should be uploaded in the folder of that page.
1. press the big plus button
2. upload photo - the name should start with feature
3. save:  press commit changes (green button in the right top) if u want put a commit message, leave the tick ticked and press the green button, commit changes.

edit name of current photo: 
1. click on the pic
2. press edit button right top (pencil icon)
3. change name
4. save:  press commit changes (green button in the right top) if u want put a commit message, leave the tick ticked and press the green button, commit changes.
this way it is handy to just check and test if the thumbnails of the pages look good in the main page and if the background looks good anyway in the page. so u can easily change the filename back if it looks shitty (which is very very possible)  
so.. check the change in the website! (it *can* take some minutes before the change is visible)

and check the change :)

Never ever hesistate calling me if in problems..
