**Performance (30 minutes)**

In Public Space, Clara Saito has been collaborating with members of the latinx collective Papaya Kuir, Patri Roa Johansen and Nadia Bekkers. Together they developed allegorical characters and a game in a tv show format as a response to the Amazon forest fires and the involvement of the Netherlands in deforestation.The project is inspired by the techniques of the Theatre of the Oppressed by Augusto Boal, as well as the book Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics by Jos√© Esteban Munoz, but also by drag and telenovela. This show is a collaborative effort to use theatre and performance as a means of exploring and addressing issues related to queer activism and social justice.
