After starring as herself funding the avant-garde revolution in the acclaimed cult movie "A Piece of Dada", after performing questions about study and community as tools againt capitalism in the show "Towards Anal", and after making an in-depth vimeo tutorial on the theme of "How to Cure Bacterial Vaginosis", Lady Dada is back at the event "Frenemy" (Rozenstraat Gallery, NL) to share her knowledge about "How to be Likable", a camp and entertaining performance about how to be social again in the aftermath of Covid, while simultaneously pushing into a toxic positivity vibe.
