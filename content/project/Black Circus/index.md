Black Circus is a collective of performers incarnating different visions of queer and anarchist thoughts and ideas. This show features individual and group performances that range from dance and music to spoken word and robots. Burlesque or cabaret can serve as a reference, but Black Circus always aim to push the boundaries of known disciplines and blur the lines between cheesy, camp and performance art. Usually the show culminates in a party where spectators and performers can meet and transform together.

Black Circus is based in Amsterdam and started as a performance night in the former squatted social space Antarctica in 2012. The performance night and parties that followed became popular and were presented in different alternative venues such as Vrankrijk and the Ship of Fools. In 2016 a regular group emerged and started to tour other countries as well.
