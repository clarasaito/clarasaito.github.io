**Performance/Installation, 60 minutes**

#1 is at first a performance which seeks for absolute freedom. It proposes a practice of anarchism for the body and the mind as a crash test before applying it to society. It is an attempt to let go of fear, judgement and frame in order to find a non-yet existing place. From this idea 6 points/guidelines were cultivated:

1. How to create a theory for a practice that doesn't want rules. How to not be ideological. How to develop anarchy in practice and thoughts simultaneously. How to not create a system. How to allow a theory where it is possible for that same theory to sabotage itself.

2. Avoiding master/slave, leader/ follower situations, whatever the leader is. Leader can be emotions/ the ego/ the brain/ judgment. The way out can have sometimes to do with play. Or with finding a third entrance. Or the third entrance is play.

3. From allowing chaos, a form of order is built organically.

4. Go for desires.

5. Start from different perspectives, not having a center point. Search for/ or accept external unexpected or expected inputs.

6. Stay independent.
