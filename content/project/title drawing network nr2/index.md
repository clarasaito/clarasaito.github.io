**Performance, 60 minutes**

\#2 revisits the practice of anarchism of #1 but in interaction between 4 characters.

{{< figure src="image-004.png" width="190px" class="aside" >}} 

The characters move inside the objectified chaos, a defined space inside the theater where they can make use of a microphone, internet, rest in a safe space or decide to enter the world.

- Concept and curation: Clara Saito
- With works by: Anonymous museum for unsigned works, Jessica, Alexander Nieuwenhuis, Petros Panagiotis Orfanos, Noha Ramadan, S.M. Snider, Cleide Saito and Clara Saito
