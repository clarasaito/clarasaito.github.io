Lady Dada is a rockstar in performance art. After making several tutorial-performances (soon on Youtube) and starring in the movie A Piece of Dada, Dada comes back to life as an avatar and attempts to dismantle capitalism through movement.

What are the choices of movement that a body makes in response to the multiplicity of information and questions we are facing every day? Where does study start? Why do I have pain in new body parts about every week since few years? What does it mean to perform dissociation? Sister Emanuelle had the same zodiac placements than me in sun sign, rising and moon. Towards Anal is about imagining ways to dismantle capitalism while asking ourselves questions to help deconstruct bodies and mind that have been shaped to accommodate such a system. Going back to important questions that thinkers such as Fred Moten, Stephano Harney, Paul Preciado have touched upon, as well as choreographers such as Deborah Hay or singer Anitta, Dada genuinely makes the move to formulate some answers through dance all of this in a camp/humouristic and overall confused style.
