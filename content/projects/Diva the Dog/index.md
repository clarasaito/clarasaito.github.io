**Event, multiple days**

Diva is a dog. The dog is the artist performing Diva for a month. Caretakers were able to volunteer to take Diva for walks in a place of their choice. During this month a camera followed these characters in their different habitats.

This experiment generated questions about productivity and instincts in addition to sticks and holes. But is a dog's existence then about questioning? Diva the dog is a work that imagine how a human would live without social construct, basing their actions on their instincts, desires and senses.
