**Drag performance**

Kurt Dickriot is a drag king character well known in the Amsterdam queer scene. He was born out of the need to make fun of boys who think that they don't need to do anything to look cool, just stand there and be. In his shows he is often presenting in a comical way his habitual self-destructive relation to pleasure dominated by alcohol and masturbation. He usually lip syncs to dramatic boy songs, such as Justin Timberlake or Blue, often after a break-up. 

By the end of his career, he tried to improve and got sober, but with soberness came unknown feelings such as feelings of guilt. Out of guilt he started to cut his dick in pieces and offer them to the audience members but after a few months of doing so, he got an infection and unfortunately left this world forever. In his last shows he shared the stage a few times with Saito's other alter egos, Lady Dada and The Confused Version of Clara Saito

Concept and performance: Clara Saito
