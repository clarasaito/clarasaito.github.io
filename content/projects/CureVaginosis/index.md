**12 minute video, 3x Screenprints on fabric, performances**

In this work, Lady Dada, a rockstar in performance arts, takes into her own hands to explain to her audience the mysteries of the vaginal bacterias and how to keep it all in balance, in a playful video containing scientific facts, somatic improvisations and 3d liquid objects. Her tutorial is framed in between two long banners portraying diverse flashy bacterias, a royal set-up to remind that the body will always rule us first.
