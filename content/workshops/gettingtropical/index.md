Getting Tropical - Part 2 at [Kunst Instituut Melly](https://www.kunstinstituutmelly.nl/en/programs/6767-session-getting-tropical-part-2) is a performance Workshop: <br>SHAKE YOUR STEREOTYPE AWAY.<br> performance arts – feminism – social sciences – artivism

Within the performative and movement practices we research in the piece Getting Tropical we have the practices of cracks: strategies to move within the gaps of colonial and institutional projects. A translation for what philosopher and babalorixá Luiz Simas calls "Brasilidade". We practice within our daily lives and studios some of them:

transgressive practices of reinvention
false domestication
re-enchantment
disobedience
working with the unknown
disidentifications

- Directed: Karina Villafan
- In close collaboration with: Clara Saito and Lara Santos
