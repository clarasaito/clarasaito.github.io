Theater of Drag workshop by Clara Saito organized by [Toi toi toi](https://extraintra.nl/initiatives/toitoitoi/toitoitoi-invite-clara-saito/) at the Rietveld Academie and Sandberg Institute.

The workshop invited people to explore using performance and theater as a transformative and political way of expressing and acting upon struggles, all of it in drag. It was informed by the Theatre of the Oppressed, a community-based technique developed by Augusto Boal. The workshop included creating characters, expressing our emotions, performing for each other, and having discussions about the struggles we face in everyday life, using humor and over-dramatization in the style of telenovelas.
