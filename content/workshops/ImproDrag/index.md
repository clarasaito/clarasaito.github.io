**Guided Improvisation — 2 hours**

The improvisation begins with an hour dedicated to transformation: a time to arrive, to socialize, and to listen inward to let a mood and a character emerge through clothing and make-up. A guided warm-up, inspired by the drama in telenovelas, then prepares the body and spirit, tuning attention and awakening sensation.

Once we are ready, the space opens into one hour of dance improvisation in character, a living terrain of movement, presence, and play.

Impro Drag is an invitation to explore how movement shifts when our sensation of self is altered. Through improvisation and encounters, we experiment with clothing and make-up as catalysts for transformation.  Questions that can be embodied through the improvisation are : how does drag influence our movement qualities, our own perceptions of body and self and our connection with others ?
