**Improvisation, 2 hours**

An hour of dance improvisation with the possibility of transformation through clothes and make-up.

Impro drag started in Jacuzzi space in the few times it was possible during the pandemic and has been taking place twice per year since then. It is a space to explore movement, having encounters through improvisation and experimentation with clothing and make-up. Questions that can be embodied through the improvisation can be how drag influences our movement qualities, our own perceptions of body and self and our connection with others.
