      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a city torn apart by a mad scramble for celebrity, Lady Dada seemingly has it all. The enigmatic performance artist lures her audience by ingesting vast amounts of money in her spectacular shows promising fame and unbound pleasure. While the public is captivated by her special gift, she has no bigger fan than Madame Gram - a glamorous but unhinged opera tycoon who is hell-bent on convincing Dada to be the star of her &amp;lsquo;Popera&amp;rsquo;. But Dada has a dirty secret. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t just eat the dollar bills - she shits them, too. Via the underground sewer system, her faeces are funding an avant-garde revolution that will topple the Opera regime once and for all. Or so she thinks&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Piece of Dada is a collective film project which was triggered by the themes and practices that they have explored with their Dutch Art Institute study group through an experimental methodology of production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The movie has been written, filmed, and acted by Clementine Edwards, Lukas Q Hoffmann, Tirza Kater, Rabea Ridlhammer, Clara Saito, Giorgos Tsiongas and Wilfred Tomescu with the support of Pauline Curnier Jardin and Sara Giannini.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
